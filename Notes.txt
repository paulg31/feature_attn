Blocking:

1) Set the last two items in design.types equal to each other.
	- No blocking, all blocks after intro blocks will be the same
	- trials will follow the design.intro_trials, design.session_trials, and design.other_trials
2) Set the last two items in design.types NOT equal to eachother.
	- THis willl block two types of trials
	- The result will be Intro trials, followed by Low Roundness and High Roundness blocks, in that order
	- You will also have to set 'block' in the experiment input for sessions 2 and 3.
	- 1 will start the session will low roundness and alternate, 2 will start the session with high
3) Set the last two item NOT equal to eachother AND change design.cue ratio to 1/3 (from 1/4)
	- This will result in the same alternation as in (2)
	- The same is required in terms of 'blobk' in the inputs
	- Changing the cue ratio results in the cue blocks including all cue conditions except null.
	- This option results in 2 null blocks, alternating cue blocks, and then 2 null blocks.

***These will be changed so that all you have to do is select 1,2, or 3***
